  Tiles used during FlyLight Split-GAL4 expression pattern imaging.
---

While most first-generation FlyLight expression pattern images are single 20x objective acquisitions, many Split-GAL4 lines were imaged using 63x or 40x objectives. This requires multiple image acquisitions to cover the CNS regions of interest. VFB integrates only the combined images derived from these tiles and lists the tiles used to create these combined images in the comment section for each image, for example: "tile(s): 'left_dorsal, right_dorsal, ventral". These tiles do not necessarily cover the entire brain or VNC, which complicates the assessment of the specificity of these lines. VFB notes in the comment where the combined tiles do not provide full coverage. For further information refer to Figure 4 Supplemental File 1 from 'A split-GAL4 driver line resource for Drosophila CNS cell types' [direct link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2024/04/01/2024.01.09.574419/DC6/embed/media-6.pdf?download=true). This is a preprint and may be updated.
