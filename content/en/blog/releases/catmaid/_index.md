## CATMAID Datasets Hosted by VFB

Virtual Fly Brain (VFB) hosts several CATMAID instances for exploring connectomic reconstruction data. These datasets provide access to neuroanatomical data from various Drosophila electron microscopy projects. Full details are available on our hosted pages:

### Adult Brain
- [FAFB (Adult Fly Brain)](/about/hosted/fafb-catmaid/) - Complete EM volume of an adult Drosophila melanogaster brain with manually traced neurons
- [FANC (Female Adult Nerve Cord)](/about/hosted/fanc-catmaid/) - Adult female ventral nerve cord with reconstructions in both original and template space

### Larval Brain
- [L1EM (First Instar Larva)](/about/hosted/l1em-catmaid/) - Complete EM volume of a Drosophila first instar larva brain with manually traced neurons

#### Comparative Studies
- [IAV-ROBO](/about/hosted/iav-robo-catmaid/) - Mechanosensory circuit study with shifted mechanosensory projections
- [IAV-TNT](/about/hosted/iav-tnt-catmaid/) - Control dataset for comparative mechanosensory circuit studies

Each dataset includes browser-based visualization of EM data, neuron reconstructions, connectivity information, and programmatic access via APIs. VFB ensures the long-term availability of these resources to the research community.
