### Geppetto

Build robust neuroscience applications.

--------------------------------


The visualisation and simulation platform focused on what matters to you.

#### Neuroscience software reimagined

Geppetto is a web-based visualisation and simulation platform to build neuroscience software applications. Reuse best practices, best compomnents, best design. Don't reinvent the wheel.

#### A completely modular platform.

Engineered together with scientists, Geppetto lets you integrate different data and models. A modular architecture allows the platform to easily support different standard formats for both experimental and computational data.

#### An open-source revolution.

Geppetto is entirely open source and engineers, scientists and developers from different research groups are contributing to its development by adding functionality to visualize and simulate new data and models.

#### Awesome in-browser 3D

Geppetto enables visualizing and interacting with 3D data in your web browser. Take advantage of out of the box support for point clouds, ball-and-stick models, line segments for large networks or arbitrarly complex meshes.

#### Extensible components based framework

A modular system of components allows both experimental and simulated data to be visualized in domain specific ways so that you can always be in control of how to present your data.

#### Fully indexed and searchable data and models

The data and models loaded inside Geppetto are fully indexed and searchable for you to always find what is most important without big data getting in the way.

#### Dynamic visualisation

We know you are used to look at your simulations only via a plot or a static rendered video. In Geppetto the 3D models can be linked to your simulation to add a dynamic visual component to your computational experiments.

#### A powerful abstraction

Geppetto defines a model abstraction capable of representing different classes of models and data, in a generic way. In this way the platform can be used over and over by different groups, becoming more and more robust, generic and smart.

### Features

Some of the features responsible for giving you an amazing experience.

Regular [releases](https://github.com/openworm/org.geppetto/releases) of Geppetto make sure components keep being updated and tested.

Help us identify what matters to you and what you would want to see built in Geppetto. Do so by logging an [enhancement request](https://github.com/openworm/org.geppetto/issues/new) on GitHub or dropping us an [email](mailto:info@geppetto.org).

### Get involved!

Help us build the next generation simulation platform!

Geppetto is entirely open source and is being built by a growing community of talented engineers and scientists. Geppetto uses different languages to achieve different goals. Geppetto runs on the Eclipse Virgo WebServer and can be deployed on different infrastructures including cloud-based ones like Amazon [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). 

Geppetto is multi-platform and works on Linux, Mac OSX and Windows, so no matter on what platform you develop there is a way for you to run it and add fantastic contributions.

Show me the code!

Right! Geppetto is hosted on GitHub, every module has its own repository to provide flexible ways of branching individual components. For every module we have at least two branches, development and master. The development branch gets merged into master each monthly release. If you want to contribute you can either go straight to the code or reach out to us dropping an [email](mailto:info@geppetto.org), we will show you around and help you contribute in your favorite way!

#### [Why are you building Geppetto?](#collapseOne)

[Read our paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2017.0380) to learn more.

Besides the functional requirements, Geppetto's goal is to move away from the monolithic approach to software that is usually found in academic programming projects.

Computational neuroscience has produced software systems, including NEURON and Genesis, that are extremely useful for simulating systems of neurons that include biophysical details ([Brette et al, 2007](http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio.NC/0611089)). A range of other algorithms have been devised in other areas of computational biology ([Barnes & Chu, 2010](http://g.ua/MhoV)) for which simulators have been produced ([Takahashi, 2004](http://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/%7Eshafi/takahashi-thesis.pdf)). Several investigations have pointed to the challenges in building a single system that integrates multiple simulation algorithms together into a single biological model ([Takahashi et al., 2002](http://g.ua/Mhx1), [Dada and Mendes, 2007](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-02879-3), [Cornelis et al., 2012](http://g.ua/Mhxa)).

Geppetto aims to address these scientific and engineering challenges. Geppetto's design leverages cutting edge software technologies. Its architecture and development follows industry standards.

#### [How is Geppetto development funded?](#collapseThree)

Building great software takes time. And money. Geppetto is no exception and as many open-source projects it is funded by a hybrid model. Geppetto's development is supported by both awesome volunteer contributors and by external companies and organisations:

*   [OpenWorm](http://openworm.org)
*   [MetaCell](http://metacell.us)
*   [Wellcome Trust](http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/) via the [Open Source Brain](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/) initiative
*   [Wellcome Trust](http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/) via [Virtual Fly Brain](http://www.virtualflybrain.org/)
*   [Orion Bionetworks](http://www.orionbionetworks.org/)

Commercial companies, academic institutions and independent research labs are welcome to get in touch with [us](mailto:info@geppetto.org) to discuss collaborations and grant applications.

#### [What is Geppetto's relationship with OpenWorm?](#collapseFour)

The decision to build Geppetto came after an analysis of the requirements for a platform able to support the [OpenWorm](http://openworm.org) full-scale simulation of the C. elegans.

Geppetto's architecture is generic and therefore the simulation of the C.elegans is just one specific simulation it is capable of. Geppetto's modules can be built to simulate and integrate any complex system.

#### [What license does Gepetto have?](#collapseFive)

Geppetto is released under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
