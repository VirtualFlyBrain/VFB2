description: >
    VFB will be running a workshop on integrating Drosophila connectomics and transcriptomics data.
---

The Drosophila neuroscience community now has access to extensive connectomics data covering the majority of the fly brain, along with a growing collection of transcriptomics data for brain cell types. Virtual Fly Brain integrates Drosophila neuroscience data, providing a platform for bridging these two data types and making them accessible for display, querying, and download.

The workshop will introduce the VFB API through practical examples, including querying and retrieving connectomics and transcriptomics data and integrating these data types in custom queries. This session is designed for experienced users of R or Python.

Thank you to everyone who attended our workshop at NeuroFly 2024. Our workshop notebook is available here: [tinyurl.com/workshopVFB](http://tinyurl.com/workshopVFB) for anyone who would like to explore the VFB API. We will keep this available and up to date.
