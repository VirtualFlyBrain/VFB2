VFB works closely with the FlyBase team and we rely on their hard work to provide many of our features. Due to the current funding situation at [FlyBase](https://flybase.org/), we encourage our users to donate and help maintain this essential resource.

Because of recent NIH impediments to international collaboration, FlyBase has divided forces:
- European labs can contribute via this crowdfunding [link](https://www.philanthropy.cam.ac.uk/give-to-cambridge/physiology-development-and-neuroscience/drosophila-genetic-database), where you can also request to make a donation from a grant.
- the FlyBase U.S. fee system will be set up soon.

We are grateful to the Wellcome Trust for their continued funding of VFB.
