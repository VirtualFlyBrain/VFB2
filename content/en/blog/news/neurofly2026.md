    Announcement of NeuroFly 2026 conference in Cologne, Germany, and VFB's plans for a workshop.
---

The 21st Biennial European Drosophila Neurobiology Conference, NeuroFly 2026, will be held at the University of Cologne, Germany, from September 7th to 11th, 2026. This conference continues the tradition of bringing together researchers from around the world to discuss the latest advancements in Drosophila neurobiology, including studies on neuronal circuits, synapses, connectome, signal transmission, behavior, development, and more. The event emphasizes interdisciplinary interactions in an inclusive environment, featuring a mix of invited talks and abstracts from both junior and senior researchers.

Virtual Fly Brain (VFB) is excited about the upcoming conference and is exploring opportunities to host a workshop/tutorial on connectomics and transcriptomics data we have available, similar to our previous successful sessions such as [NeuroFly 2024](neurofly2024.md) titled 'Bridging connectomics and transcriptomics' ([workshop notebook](http://tinyurl.com/workshopVFB)). This new workshop will introduce available connectomes and transcriptomics data, highlight important differences between datasets, and demonstrate how to perform your own analysis using the latest [tools](/docs/Tutorials/APIs/Connectome/tools) and [APIs](/docs/Tutorials/APIs/) for integrating Drosophila neuroscience data. Stay tuned for updates on our participation.
