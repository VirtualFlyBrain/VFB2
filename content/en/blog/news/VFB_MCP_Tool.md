We're excited to announce the launch of the **Virtual Fly Brain Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tool** — a powerful new way to explore VFB data through Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude, providing natural language access to VFB's comprehensive neuroanatomical database.

## What is the VFB MCP Tool?

The VFB MCP tool integrates Virtual Fly Brain's rich neuroanatomical data with LLM capabilities, allowing researchers to:

- **Query VFB data conversationally** - Ask questions about neurons, brain regions, and connectivity in natural language
- **Discover morphological similarities** - Use integrated NBLAST queries to find similar neurons
- **Explore neuroanatomical concepts** - Get detailed information about transgenic constructs, neuron types, and anatomical structures
- **Visualize results** - Access 3D visualizations of neurons and brain regions directly in your chat interface

## How It Works

The tool provides seamless access to VFB's databases through a simple interface. Whether you're asking about a specific neuron type, learning about a transgenic construct, or exploring the diversity of neurons in the medulla, the MCP tool retrieves and presents the information in an easy-to-understand format.

### Example Queries

**Anatomical Exploration:**
- "What is the Medulla Forming Neuroblast and what role does it play?"
- "What types of neurons are in the medulla?"
- "Show me the definition and structure of the medulla"

**Gene and Construct Queries:**
- "What is P{E(spl)m8-HLH-2.61} and where is it used?"
- "Tell me about the E(spl)m8 gene"

**Neuromorphology and Connectivity:**
- "Can you show me what the IN02A049 neuron looks like?"
- "How are NBLAST scores calculated for comparing neurons?"

## Getting Started

Visit the **[VFB MCP Tool](https://vfb3-mcp.virtualflybrain.org/)** to begin exploring. You can:

1. Access through Claude or other MCP-compatible LLMs
2. Browse the integration documentation and examples
3. Learn how to incorporate VFB data queries into your research workflows

## Why This Matters

This tool democratizes access to VFB's complex neuroanatomical data, making it accessible to researchers without deep programming expertise. Scientists can now leverage the power of LLMs to explore connectomics data, neuroanatomy, and gene expression patterns in natural conversation.
