## Overview

BrainTrap was developed as part of a large-scale collaborative research project to collect protein expression location information from protein-trap lines generated by the Cambridge Protein Trap (CPT) project. The database provides detailed 3D confocal datasets showing protein expression patterns throughout the adult Drosophila brain.

## Features

- Interactive web-based viewer for exploring 3D confocal datasets
- Full-size images throughout the brain volume can be viewed interactively
- Secondary immunohistochemical label (anti-brp) aids navigation and helps identify brain structures
- Searchable annotations linked to the FlyBase Drosophila anatomy ontology
- Anatomical search criteria can be specified using:
  - Automatic term completion
  - Hierarchical browser for the ontology
- Annotation provenance tracking with highlighted expression locations
- Downloadable confocal dataset files in original format
- XML format annotation data export
- Gene comparison tables for selected genes
